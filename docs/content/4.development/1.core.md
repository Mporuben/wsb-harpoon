# Core

This is guide for opening Pull request to the wsb harpoon monorepository.

## Setup 


### Clone repository
```sh
git clone git@github.com:Mporuben/wsb-harpoon.git
```


### Init project
Preferably use docker for development to avoid problems with node version or colision with your
wsb harpoon setup that you actually use for analysis.
```sh
docker compose run dev  sh --rm
npm install
```

### Expose wsb-harpoon command
```
cd packages/core
npm link
```

### Build project
```
npm run build
```



## Rules
### Stupid simple core
Core should handle just package management and provide simple SDK for plugins to use.
It should not provide any actual functionality.

### Coupling
Core can't be dependent on any plugin and plugins should not be dependent on other plugins

### SDK  
SDK should be as simple as possible. It should provide straightforward declarative way to create plugins
