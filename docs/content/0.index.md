# Project
This project started as a hobby project to help me with my investment research. 
I've decided to make it open source so everyone can use it and contribute to it.
If you are interested in contributing check [development section](/development).
Feel free to open issues, pull requests or create you own plugin.
If you have any question you can find my contact details on my [website](https://matthewporuben.com/).
